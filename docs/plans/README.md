# Plans index

The one-minute "what's in flight" view. Read this first each session instead of
re-deriving state from `git log`. Completed plans move to `done/`.

**Next free number: 0007**

## Active roster

| Plan | Title                                   | Status | Summary |
|------|-----------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| [0003](0003-generative-scenes-and-presets.md) | Generative scenes + data-driven presets | in-progress (paused) | **Paused mid-implementation by the user.** Shadertoy-style fragment-field scene + ~10k-particle CPU swarm, driven by TOML+expression presets (ADR-0002 layers 1-2). DSP enriched with bass/mid/treb + deterministic tempo/BPM. **Amended: adds Phase 0** (relocate scenes under `render/` + panic-pragma guard, closing the 0002 review gap). Defers Rhai, blending, compute-scale. Drafts roadmap item 1. |
| [0004](0004-foobar-ui-element-panel.md) | foo_lmv as an embeddable Default UI panel | approved | Register a Default UI `ui_element` so the visualizer docks as a layout panel, not just a pop-out window. Keeps both entry points sharing one wgpu surface via a single claimable `VizSession`; right-click "Next scene"; throttle + pause-when-hidden. Plugin-only, no ABI change. Relates to roadmap item 4 (UX). |
| [0005](0005-miri-ring-extraction.md) | Extract the lock-free ring into a wgpu-free crate for Miri | approved | Implements Plan 0002's deferred Phase 5: pull the SPSC ring out of `core/src/audio.rs` into a zero-dep `lmv-ring` crate, then run `cargo +nightly miri test -p lmv-ring` as a fast CI UB gate (no wgpu graph to compile). Rejected feature-gating wgpu in `lmv-core`. Behavior-preserving. |
| [0006](0006-versioning-wiring.md) | Versioning: single source of truth + cargo-release + surfacing | draft | Implements [ADR-0005](../adrs/0005-versioning-and-release-cadence.md): collapse the workspace's two `0.1.0` strings into one `[workspace.package].version`, adopt `cargo-release` (`--no-push`, tag `vX.Y.Z`) as the single bump authority run once per plan at the architect close, surface the version in the standalone title. Keeps `0.1.0` baseline; C-ABI version stays a separate axis; plugin version independent. dev wires it, human installs cargo-release + confirms baseline. |

## Recently closed

- [0002 — Rust enforcement tooling](done/0002-rust-enforcement-tooling.md) —
  **done 2026-07-21**, passed Mode 4 review (no blockers). Phases 0-4 landed and are green
  locally (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, both hygiene guards, cargo-deny). Panic pragma on all 7
  core hot-path files with reasoned in-bounds escapes; no production hot-path panics.
  **⚠ Carried forward (both now tracked as their own work — no loose ends):**
  1. **Phase 5 (Miri CI job) was DEFERRED, not run** — `lmv-core`'s lib pulls the full
     wgpu/naga graph, so a full-crate Miri job is impractical (>10 min). The ring IS verified
     UB-clean locally (`cargo +nightly miri test -p lmv-core --lib`, all 5 ring tests incl. the
     cross-thread SPSC case, 95 s); only the CI automation was outstanding. **→ Now
     [Plan 0005](0005-miri-ring-extraction.md)** (draft): extract the ring into a zero-dep
     `lmv-ring` crate and run Miri against it.
  2. **Scenes were per-frame render code outside the hot-path pragma set / guard scan.** **→
     Folded into [Plan 0003](0003-generative-scenes-and-presets.md) Phase 0** (amendment):
     relocate scenes under `core/src/render/scenes/` so the guard's existing recursive `render/`
     scan covers them structurally, and add the panic pragma to each — done before 0003 fills
     `scenes/` with heavy per-frame indexing.
- [0001 — Core + standalone MVP, then foobar parity](done/0001-core-and-standalone-mvp.md) —
  **done 2026-07-21**, passed Mode 4 review (no blockers; C ABI recorded in
  [ADR-0003](../adrs/0003-c-abi-v1-surface.md)). Windows standalone + foobar2000 plugin
  smoke-tested; 9/9 tests green.
  **⚠ Carried forward: Phase 10 (macOS validation on real hardware, human) was DEFERRED, not
  run** — the plan was closed early on the user's request with the Mac path still unverified
  on-device (it compiles via CI only). When a Mac is available: run the standalone on macOS
  13+, grant the screen-recording permission, confirm live visuals; report results and route
  any fixes to `dev` (the `capture_mac` path). This is the one outstanding piece of v1.

**Open gap (from the 0001/0002 reviews):** the **C ABI has no automated test coverage** — the
C++ shim is not built in CI, and no in-crate FFI test exists. 0002 armed the pragma and
supply-chain gates but did not add an FFI test (it was never a 0002 phase). A minimal
`lmv_create`/`push`/`free` Rust-side test remains an unassigned candidate for a future plan;
Miri (the deferred 0002 Phase 5) would cover the ring/FFI pointer handling once it runs.

## Roadmap (agreed 2026-07-21, revised same day for the live-show use case; numbers assigned when drafted)

Execution order after Plan 0001, per the NFR interviews ([docs/nfr.md](../nfr.md)):

1. **Preset / scripting engine** — layered presets per
   [ADR-0002](../adrs/0002-layered-preset-architecture.md): TOML data + expression language
   driving built-in systems (feedback/warp, boids, walkers/growth, 3D scene), with an
   optional budgeted Rhai script for staged per-track arcs (NFR §10). Replaces "scenes are
   Rust code" — Plan 0001's Scene trait becomes the rendering vocabulary presets drive, so
   keep it thin. **Started as [Plan 0003](0003-generative-scenes-and-presets.md)** (layers 1-2:
   fragment-field + swarm systems, data + expression presets); Rhai (layer 3), blending, and
   compute-scale particles remain follow-ups tracked in 0003.
2. **Live performance features** — line-in/audio-interface capture, scene triggers
   (auto-rotate + hotkey/MIDI + experimental track-change detection), fullscreen on a
   chosen display/projector, 4-hour soak stability (NFR §10).
3. **Adaptive quality + runtime-memory trim** — quality tiers + frame-time governor for the
   60 fps iGPU floor (NFR §1), plus cutting the standalone's ~200 MB working set (NFR §12).
   The memory trim's primary lever — compiling wgpu with only the per-OS backend feature
   (DX12/Metal), dropping the dead Vulkan/GL paths — is a cheap, low-risk win that can
   front-run the full tier system. Both validated on the older iGPU test PC (footprint stated
   before/after; the backend trim must not regress the §1 floor).
4. **Remaining v1 UX** — always-on-top / mini mode, settings persistence (NFR §11;
   fullscreen/multi-monitor land earlier with live features).
5. **Packaging & release** — GitHub release zip: unsigned standalone exe +
   `.fb2k-component` (NFR §8).

Later, unordered: better tempo tracking, preset sharing/library, signed installer.

## Conventions

- **Numbering:** sequential, zero-padded 4 digits. Take the next free number above, then
  bump it here in the same session.
- **Phases:** ordered, each one commit, each tagged `**Owner skill:**` with one value from the
  vocabulary `dev` (all code) or `human` (a task only the user can do). The `dev` skill reads
  this tag at the start of each phase; a missing tag is a Mode 4 review blocker. An optional
  `**Area:**` note (`core` / `standalone` / `plugin`) orients the reader but is not the tag.
- **Skills:** `architect` designs and owns `docs/`; `dev` implements all code. `architect`
  writes and closes plans; `dev` flips `draft → in-progress` at "go" and nothing else in the file.
- **Lifecycle:** `draft` → `approved` (user/architect validated it; ready for `dev`) →
  `in-progress` → `done` (then `git mv` to `done/` and drop from this roster). Review
  happens at plan end, in a fresh `/architect` session — not by the session that wrote
  the code.
